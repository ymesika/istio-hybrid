# Using Istio Across Private and Public Clusters

In this Code Pattern, we will create a hybrid cloud by connecting services
between [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/private) (ICP) and
[IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service)
(IKS) Kubernetes clusters using [Istio](https://istio.io/). We assume that
the ICP is not accessible from outside of the organization network but can
still access the IKS cluster. Therefore allows us to setup a bi-directional
communication between services running on ICP and IKS through a VPN tunnel
initiated by the ICP cluster.

When you complete this Code Pattern, you will understand how to:

* Connect a private and a public cloud using a VPN tunnel
* Distribute micro-services between the private and public clusters yet maintain bi-directional connectivity
* Use Istio to conduct the multi-cluster traffic routing

While the example application used by this Code Pattern requires an IBM Cloud
Kubernetes Service for its
[Watson Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/), the
pattern presented here can be used to integrate most of the private and public
cluster.

We will deploy Istio on each cluster so that the communication between services
will be routed according to the location of the service. When calling a remote
service, Istio will route the traffic from the local calling service to the
local egress, from there to the ingress of the remote cluster and eventually
the remote destination service.

In this Code Pattern we took IBM's
[Guestbook v2 example application](https://github.com/IBM/guestbook/tree/master/v2)
and configured our Multi-Cluster so that the `Guestbook` and `Redis`
micro-services are running on an IKS cluster and the `Analyzer` service is
running on the ICP cluster. This demonstrates communication between the
clusters as `Guestbook` is calling the remote `Analyzer` service while
`Analyzer` itself is calling the `Watson Tone Analyzer` service from the IBM
Cloud.

## Flow

1. Users of the Guestbook app use their browser to access the Guestbook web page
served by the `guestbook` service from the public cloud.
1. Upon submission of a guest comment, the `guestbook` service needs to enrich
it with an emoticon base on the submitted text tone. The `guestbook` service
calls the `analyzer` service with the submitted text for the tone analysis. The
`guestbook` service calls the `analyzer` service as if it was a local service.
I.e. the service/app hasn't been modified to support remote services.
1. `analyzer` service is running on the remote private cloud therefore call is
routed by Istio through the VPN tunnel into the Ingress gateway of the private
cloud.
1. `analyzer` service calls the _Watson Tone Analyzer_ service with the received
text payload and get back the tone analysis result from the public service.
1. Once response from `analyzer` service has arrived the `guestbook` adds the
matching emoticon to the submitted text in the web page.

## 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `istio-hybrid` locally. In a terminal, run:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/istio-hybrid
```

## 2. Setup strongSwan VPN

`strongSwan` is used to setup a IPSec VPN tunnel between clusters and share
subnets of Kubernetes Pods and Services to remote clusters. As such, the
deployment has two parts where in one the strongSwan is deployed on the public
cluster as a VPN "server" and the other part installing the strongSwan as a
"client" on the private cluster. Because the private cluster can access the
public one but not vice versa, the "client" is the one that initiates the VPN
tunnel.

Instructions below connects an ICP cluster that has no public access to an IKS
cluster.

### Install strongSwan on IKS

1. Set up Helm in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service by following
[these instructions](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_integrations.html#helm).
1. [Install strongSwan to public IKS Cluster using Helm chart](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_vpn.html#vpn).
Example configuration parameters (from [`config.yaml`](config.yaml)) for the
strongSwan Helm release on an IKS (the rest as default):
    
    * ipsec.auto: `add`
    * remote.subnet: `10.0.0.0/24`

1. Execute:

    ```console
    $ kubectl get svc vpn-strongswan
    ```

    And write down the External IP of the service as you will need it when
    installing on ICP.

### Install strongSwan on ICP

1. [Complete the strongSwan IPSec VPN workarounds](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS2L37_2.1.0.3/cam_strongswan.html)
for ICP.
1. Install the strongSwan from [the Catalog in the management console](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0.3/app_center/create_release.html).  
Example configuration parameters for the strongSwan Helm release on an ICP:
    
    * Chart name: `vpn`
    * Namespace: `default`
    * Operation at startup: `start`
    * Local subnets: `10.0.0.0/24`
    * Local id: `on-prem`
    * Remote gateway: _Public IP of IKS VPN service that you wrote down earlier_
    * Remote subnets: `172.30.0.0/16,172.21.0.0/16`
    * Remote id: `ibm-cloud`
    * Privileged authority for VPN pod: checked

1. Verify that ICP connected to IKS by running the following against the IKS:

    ```console
    $ export STRONGSWAN_POD=$(kubectl get pod -l app=strongswan,release=vpn -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }')
    $ kubectl exec $STRONGSWAN_POD -- ipsec status
    ```

    If configured correctly the output of the command will list one established connection:

    ```console
    Security Associations (1 up, 0 connecting):
    k8s-conn[10]: ESTABLISHED 65 minutes ago, 172.30.0.107[ibm-cloud]...10.113.87.181[on-prem]
    k8s-conn{34}:  INSTALLED, TUNNEL, reqid 9, ESP in UDP SPIs: c46d5d8d_i c688564f_o
    k8s-conn{34}:   172.21.0.0/16 172.30.0.0/16 === 10.0.0.0/24
    ```

## 3. Setup Kubeconfig

Make sure the two target clusters are available as contexts in the Kubeconfig path:

```console
$ export KUBECONFIG=[location_of_kubeconfig_for_IKS_context]:[location_of_kubeconfig_for_ICP_context]
$ kubectl config get-contexts
```

The kubeconfig context name for each one of the clusters will be used as configuration parameters to the installation scripts.

You can test that both clusters are accessible with the context name by executing the command:

```console
$ kubectl get nodes --context=<cluster_IKS_context>
$ kubectl get nodes --context=<cluster_ICP_context>
```

## 4. Setup Watson Tone Analyzer with IBM Cloud

[Watson Tone Analyzer](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone-analyzer) detects the tone from the words that users enter into the Guestbook app. The tone is converted to the corresponding emoticons.

1. Use `bx target --cf` or `bx target -o ORG -s SPACE` to set the Cloud Foundry org and space where you want to provision the service.

1. Create Watson Tone Analyzer in your account.

    ```console
    $ ibmcloud service create tone_analyzer lite my-tone-analyzer-service
    ```

1. Create a service key for the service.

    ```console
    $ ibmcloud service key-create my-tone-analyzer-service myKey
    ```

1. Show the service key that you created and note the **password** and **username**.

      ```console
      $ ibmcloud service key-show my-tone-analyzer-service myKey
      ```
 
> Save the **username** and **password** for your `config.sh` file in the next step.

## 5. Configure

Edit the `config.sh` file with the necessary settings:

```sh
# Cluster A Kubeconfig context
CLUSTER_A=<cluster_IKS_context>

# Cluster B Kubeconfig context
CLUSTER_B=<cluster_ICP_context>

# Watson Tone Analyzer service credentials
TONE_ANALYZER_USERNAME="username"
TONE_ANALYZER_PASSWORD="password"
```

## 6. Install

Execute the installation script:

```console
$ ./install.sh
```

The script will pause after installing Istio v1.0.0 on both clusters and wait for you to press any key. Before continuing, make sure all Istio pods are running on *both* clusters:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -n istio-system --context=<cluster_IKS_context>
$ kubectl get pods -n istio-system --context=<cluster_ICP_context>
```

The script continues and the Guestbook web page URL will be printed at the end. You can open this URL in your browser.

## 7. Verify

If the integration between the two clusters has been established you should see the _Tone Analyzer_ service response added in the form of text emoticons to the Guestbook history.

1. Launch the Guestbook web page by opening in your browser the URL printed at the end of the installation
1. Type in the Guestbook text field a sentence (e.g. `I just love this app`) and hit the submit button
1. The history text at the top should show the sentence you entered along with a text emoticon based on the result from the Analyzer service.

<!--Include any troubleshooting tips (driver issues, etc)-->

<!-- # Troubleshooting

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Discovery
environment is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass. The environment should
be usable on restart. If you used `Deploy to IBM Cloud` the restart should be automatic.

* Error: Only one free environent is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Discovery environment is created. If you already have
a Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Discovery, check for an old
service thay you may want to delete. Otherwise use the .env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID to tell
the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment
using the default configuration. -->
